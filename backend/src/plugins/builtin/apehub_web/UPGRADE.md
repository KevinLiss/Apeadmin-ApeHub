# Apehub_web Upgrade Notes

## Version 1.10.0

Migration `v0016_coze_provider.py` adds Coze workflow as a third AI provider,
dedicated to the "AI completion" feature (code → documentation). Two new columns
on `apehub_web_site_config`:

- `coze_api_key` (VARCHAR(512), encrypted) — Coze PAT token
- `coze_workflow_id` (VARCHAR(64)) — Coze workflow ID

**MySQL note**: `coze_api_key` uses VARCHAR(512) instead of TEXT because MySQL
does not allow TEXT columns to have a default value.

Coze only handles code→documentation generation. Refinement features (optimize
documentation/changelog) continue to use DeepSeek or Qwen.

Configure `ai_provider = "coze"` in the admin configuration page, then set the
Coze API Key and Workflow ID.

## Version 1.8.0

Migration `v0015_cny_pricing.py` switches the marketplace to CNY pricing:

- Plugin prices are now in CNY (¥), with a minimum of ¥3 (or free).
- Order amounts remain CNY; developer revenue is converted to USDT via
  `usdt_cny_rate` (default 7.2).
- Payment channels: Alipay / WeChat Pay / USDT.
- Developer earnings and withdrawals remain USDT-TRC20.

New config fields: `usdt_cny_rate`, `currency` (default "USDT" for accounting).

## Version 1.7.0

Migration `v0014_releases.py` adds `apehub_web_release` table for ApeAdmin base
release package management. Administrators can upload, publish, and manage base
installation packages visible on the public download page.

## Version 1.6.0

Migration `v0013_mcp_tools.py` adds the `mcp_tools` JSON column to
`apehub_web_plugin`, allowing plugins to declare their MCP tool inventory for
AI Agent discovery and invocation.

## Version 1.5.0

Migration `v0011_theme_mode.py` adds the `theme_mode` column to
`apehub_web_site_config` (default "light"). The public website reads this as the
default theme, with client-side toggle support.

## Version 1.4.0

Migrations `v0007_marketplace_foundation.py` and `v0008_docs_portal.py` add the
closed-loop ApeHub marketplace: developer package uploads, safe ZIP inspection,
DeepSeek-generated Markdown documentation, versioned review and publishing,
permanent purchase entitlements, USDT/LemPay callbacks, refund protection,
settlement ledger, and TRC20 withdrawal requests with administrator approval
and manual payout.

The admin site configuration now controls encrypted DeepSeek and LemPay
credentials, service fee percentage, settlement days, refund days, minimum
withdrawal amount, and withdrawal fee policy. The default minimum withdrawal is
`100 USDT`; all marketplace amounts use USDT with eight-decimal accounting.
The documentation entry points to the bundled VitePress portal at
`/apehub-web/docs-portal/`.

## Version 1.3.0

Migration `v0006_navigation_and_installations.py` adds configurable public
navigation and reliable installation metrics. The default navigation includes
Home, Plugin Marketplace, Documentation, and Profile. The management page can
create, sort, enable, disable, and delete navigation entries, and can upload
PNG/JPEG/GIF/WebP site images up to 5MB.

Plugin management now includes package-file review, status transitions,
purchase order count, unique buyer count, unique installer count, download
count, reviewer file download, and protected deletion. Plugins with paid
orders cannot be deleted and must be taken offline instead.

## Version 1.2.2

Migration `v0005_legacy_asset_path.py` replaces the retired default
`/apeui/assets/logo.png` reference with the bundled Apehub_web logo. Other
custom Logo values remain untouched.

## Version 1.2.1

Migration `v0004_default_assets.py` supplies the legacy static assets as
defaults: `/apehub-web/assets/logo.png` for the site logo and
`/apehub-web/assets/screenshot.png` for the Hero image. It updates only blank
fields, so a configured custom image is never overwritten.

## Version 1.2.0

Migration `v0003_email_verification.py` adds the
`apehub_web_email_verification` table. Registration now requires a one-time
six-digit code delivered through the configured QQ SMTP account. Codes are
stored only as keyed digests, expire after five minutes, are consumed after
one successful use, and are rate-limited by email and request IP.

Configure `mail_user`, `mail_code`, `mail_host` (`smtp.qq.com`), and
`mail_port` (`465`) in the Apehub_web management configuration before enabling
public registration. The configuration API never returns `mail_code`; sending
an empty value on an update also preserves the existing authorization code.

## Version 1.1.0

## Scope

Version 1.1.0 replaces the retired `apeui` plugin identity with the
plugin-owned `apehub_web` identity:

- API: `/api/v1/apehub-web`
- Static site: `/apehub-web`
- Database tables: `apehub_web_*`
- Permissions: `apehub_web:*`

## Legacy data migration

On the first installation, migration `v0002_migrate_apeui.py` detects the
legacy `apeui_site_config` table and copies all supported `apeui_*` records
into matching `apehub_web_*` tables. It preserves primary keys and foreign-key
references, so existing documents, plugins, files, demos, orders, incomes, and
withdrawals remain readable.

The migration is recorded in `apehub_web_schema_version` and therefore runs
only once. It does not delete the old `apeui_*` tables. Keep those tables until
the copied data has been checked and a separately approved backup/retirement
procedure is performed.

If a target `apehub_web_*` table already contains data while legacy data is
still present, migration stops with an explicit error rather than merging two
unknown data sets. Resolve that conflict from a backup or a reviewed migration
plan, then retry.

## Lifecycle behavior

- Reinstall is idempotent: tables, seed records, menu records, and role grants
  are checked before creation.
- Disable hides the plugin menu branch and unregisters its runtime routes while
  retaining plugin data by default.
- Enable restores the shipped menu branch and runtime routes.
- Uninstall with `keep_data=true` removes the package and runtime resources but
  preserves `apehub_web_*` data. Setting `keep_data=false` drops only the
  `apehub_web_*` tables.

## Upgrade order

1. Back up the database and the existing plugin package.
2. Disable the retired plugin if it is active.
3. Import `apehub_web-1.1.0.zip`.
4. Confirm schema versions 1 and 2 exist in `apehub_web_schema_version`.
5. Compare row counts between legacy and new tables before retiring legacy data.
